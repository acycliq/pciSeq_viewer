# Installation

Install straight from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/acycliq/pciSeq_3d.git@dev_3d
```

That installs pciSeq itself. Parts of it that need more are **extras**, optional sets of
dependencies that pip installs only when asked for by name in square brackets. There is
one so far, `mcp`: the [MCP server](./api/mcp-server.md), which lets an agent such as
Claude Code answer questions about a finished run. It is an extra because it brings a web
server stack that nothing else in pciSeq uses.

```bash
pip install "pciSeq_3d[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/acycliq/pciSeq_3d.git@dev_3d"
```

For development, clone it and install in editable mode so edits to the source are picked up
without reinstalling. The extras go after the dot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acycliq/pciSeq_3d.git
cd pciSeq_3d
pip install -e .           # pciSeq
pip install -e ".[mcp]"    # pciSeq with the MCP server
```

Python 3.10 or later. The dependencies are pulled in by pip. The image tiling functions need
libvips, which arrives with the `pyvips[binary]` wheel; on a platform with no such wheel the
rest of the package still imports and only `tile_maker` and `stage_image` raise, with a
message pointing at the libvips install page. `read_tiles` does not need libvips.

## Versions

```python
import pciSeq
pciSeq.__version__     # '0.0.66.dev0'
pciSeq.__commit__      # short git hash, eg '6db6dc8'
pciSeq.__branch__      # 'dev_3d'
pciSeq.__commit_date__  # when that commit was made, eg '2026-09-25T15:02:11+01:00'
```

The version string lives in `pciSeq/_version.py`. `__commit__`, `__branch__` and
`__commit_date__` are read from git when the package is imported from a checkout,
otherwise from the values baked in when it was built. On the command line, `pciseq --version` prints the version string.

The model changes between commits. Two results are directly comparable only when the
commit matches, or when the changes in between are known. Every run records it, see below.

## Run provenance

Every run records the code and the environment that produced it, so a result can be
traced back to them:

```python
varBayes.metadata
# {'version':          '0.0.66.dev0',
#  'branch':           'dev_3d',
#  'commit':           '6db6dc8',
#  'commit_date':      '2026-09-04T11:30:02+01:00',
#  'created_at':       '2026-09-04T12:47:51Z',
#  'python_version':   '3.10.18',
#  'os':               'Linux 6.8.0-138-generic',
#  'package_versions': {'numpy': '2.2.6', 'scipy': '1.15.3',
#                       'pandas': '2.3.3', 'numba': '0.62.1'}}
```

No hostname or user name is recorded.

`varBayes` is the fitted model returned by [`cell_type`](api/reference.md#cell-type), or
loaded from the pickle when `save_data` is on. The same dictionary is written into the saved
output in two more places, so it survives without the live object:

- `diagnostics.db`, under the `pciSeq_provenance` key of the `metadata` table:

  ```python
  import sqlite3, json

  con = sqlite3.connect('<output_path>/pciSeq/data/viewer_data/diagnostics/diagnostics.db')
  row = con.execute(
      "select value from metadata where key = 'pciSeq_provenance'").fetchone()
  print(json.loads(row[0]))
  ```

- the [SpatialData store](api/spatialdata-store.md#provenance), as `sdata.attrs['pciseq']`,
  together with the resolved run config, without `label_map`.

`commit` is the one to quote when comparing two runs.
