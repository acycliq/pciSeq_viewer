Pass any of these as an `opts` dictionary to [`fit`](./reference#fit).
Anything you leave out keeps its default shown below.

```python
import pciSeq
opts = {'max_iter': 500, 'CellCallTolerance': 0.01}
cellData, geneData = pciSeq.fit(spots=spots, coo=coo, scRNAseq=ref, opts=opts)
```

### `exclude_genes`

**Default:** `[]`

Genes to exclude from cell calling, for example ['Aldoc', 'Id2'].

### `max_iter`

**Default:** `1000`

Maximum number of iterations. The loop ends here if the CellCallTolerance
criterion has not been met.

### `CellCallTolerance`

**Default:** `0.02`

Stopping threshold. Iteration stops when the maximum absolute change in the
spot-to-cell assignment probabilities between two consecutive iterations,
taken over all spots and candidate cells, is below this value.

### `Inefficiency`

**Default:** `0.2`

Global scale factor on the cell type definitions, and the first
hyperparameter to tune on a new dataset. Every mean expression
value is multiplied by it before cells are scored, so it sets the overall
number of spots the model expects per cell. At 0.2, a gene with mean
expression 100 in a cell type is expected to give about 20 spots in a cell
of that type.

Higher values raise the expected counts, so cells with few spots are more
often assigned to the Zero class. Lower values have the opposite effect.

Inefficiency is the first of four multiplicative factors on the expected
counts, from the broadest to the most specific:

| factor       | scope                        | prior strength |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Inefficiency | all genes in all cells       | fixed          |
| eta          | a given gene, all cells      | rGene          |
| theta        | a given cell, all genes      | rTheta         |
| gamma        | a given gene in a given cell | rSpot          |

Inefficiency is set directly. eta, theta and gamma are estimated from the
data, each with a prior of mean 1 whose strength is set by the
corresponding hyperparameter.

### `rGene`

**Default:** `20`

Prior strength for eta, the per-gene detection factor. eta is the ratio of
the gene's observed count to its expected count over all cells, with a
Gamma(rGene, rGene) prior of mean 1. The estimate is
`eta = (observed + rGene) / (expected + rGene)`.

rGene acts as a pseudo-count. When it is small relative to the gene's total
count, eta is determined by the data; when it is large, eta stays close to 1.

### `rTheta`

**Default:** `25.0`

Prior strength for theta, the per-cell scale factor. theta is the ratio of
the cell's observed count to the count expected under a candidate cell type,
with a Gamma(rTheta, rTheta) prior of mean 1. The estimate is the posterior
mode, `theta = (observed + rTheta - 1) / (expected + rTheta)`.

When rTheta is small relative to the cell's total count, theta is determined
by the data; when it is large, theta stays close to 1. Must be greater than
1, otherwise a cell with no spots gets a theta of zero or less.

### `rSpot`

**Default:** `2`

Dispersion of the negative binomial model for gene counts. The negative
binomial is used instead of a Poisson because gene counts vary more between
cells of the same type than a Poisson allows. rSpot is also the prior
strength for gamma, the per-cell, per-gene scale factor, which has a
Gamma(rSpot, rSpot) prior; integrating gamma out gives the negative binomial.
Lower values allow more variation in a gene's count between cells of the
same type; higher values allow less, and the model approaches a Poisson.

### `InsideCellBonus`

**Default:** `0`

Bonus added to the log score of the cell whose segmentation label contains
the spot. 0 disables it. True is converted to 2, with a warning. Non-zero
values make spot assignment depend on the exact position of the
segmentation boundaries.

### `mrf_beta`

**Default:** `1.0`

Strength of the spatial prior, a Markov random field on the cell types. When
a cell is scored, each cell type receives a bonus of mrf_beta times the
distance-weighted sum of the neighbouring cells' probabilities for that type.
0 disables the spatial prior.

The prior is most informative where cell types are spatially organised, for
example in cortical layers, and least informative where they are intermixed.

### `mrf_pooled_classes`

**Default:** `None`

Groups of cell types that the spatial prior does not distinguish. A
neighbour's probability for any type in a group counts towards every type in
the group, so all types in a group receive the same spatial bonus and are
separated by their gene counts alone. This is useful when a rare type occurs
inside a region dominated by a closely related type.

A list of groups, each a list of two or more cell type names matching the
columns of `scRNAseq`, for example `[["037 DG Glut", "038 DG-PIR Ex IMN"]]`.
A cell type can belong to one group only. None means no groups.

The spatial bonuses of the types in a group add up, so a large group can take
cells from types outside it. Groups should be kept small. See
[Pooling sister classes](../the-model/cell-class.md#pooling-sister-classes).

### `MisreadDensity`

**Default:** `1e-05`

Prior mean of the background density, in spots per unit volume. Spots not
explained by any cell, such as RNA in cell processes or technical misreads,
are modelled as a uniform background over the imaged region, and each spot
is assigned to one of its neighbouring cells or to the background. Higher
values assign more spots to the background; lower values assign more spots
to cells.

A separate density is estimated for each gene, with a
Gamma(rRho, rRho / MisreadDensity) prior.

Volume is measured in xy pixels, with z scaled by voxel_size[2] /
voxel_size[0]. For example, 100 x 100 pixels over 10 planes with voxel size
[0.28, 0.28, 0.7] is a volume of 100 x 100 x 10 x 2.5 = 250,000, and one
expected misread of a gene in that block is a density of 4e-6.

A number or a dictionary with a 'default' key, for example
`{'default': 1e-6}`. A number is converted to `{'default': value}`. Only the
'default' key is used; per-gene entries are ignored.

### `rRho`

**Default:** `1.0`

Prior strength for the per-gene background density. The prior is
Gamma(rRho, rRho / MisreadDensity), with mean MisreadDensity, and rRho acts
as a pseudo-count against the number of spots of the gene assigned to the
background. When rRho is small relative to that number, the density is
determined by the data; when it is large, every gene stays close to
MisreadDensity.

### `cell_centroid_prior`

**Default:** `10`

Not used.

### `cell_cov_prior`

**Default:** `10`

Not used.

### `SpotReg`

**Default:** `0.1`

Constant added to the expected counts, in spots per cell. Without it, one
spot of a gene with zero expression in a cell type would give that type zero
likelihood, however well the other genes match. The constant allows for such
spots arising from technical errors. It is also the expected count of every
gene in the Zero class.

### `nNeighbors`

**Default:** `9`

Number of nearest cells considered for each spot, and number of neighbouring
cells used by the spatial prior. Each spot is scored against its nNeighbors
nearest cells and the background, so at 9 there are ten candidates. Higher
values let a spot be assigned to a more distant cell, at a higher cost per
iteration. Lower values are faster, but a spot near a cell boundary may miss
the cell it belongs to.

### `save_data`

**Default:** `True`

Write the results to `<output_path>/pciSeq/data/`: cell, spot and cell
boundary tables as tsv and feather files, a SpatialData zarr store, the
diagnostics database, and the fitted model as a pickle.

### `verbose`

**Default:** `False`

Log the run time of each step and, for each iteration, the cells and spots
with the largest changes. Does not affect the result, but adds computation
to every iteration.

### `elbo_per_step`

**Default:** `[]`

Steps of the variational loop at which the ELBO is evaluated, before and
after the step, with the change logged. Valid names are geneCount_upd,
rho_upd, eta_upd, theta_upd, gamma_upd, cell_to_cellType, dalpha_upd and
spots_to_cell; "all" selects every step. An empty list disables it.
Evaluating the ELBO is expensive, so selecting many steps slows the run
considerably. Intended for development.

### `output_path`

**Default:** `'default'`

Directory for the results. Output is written to `<output_path>/pciSeq/`.
'default' uses the system temporary directory.

### `cell_radius`

**Default:** `None`

Radius of the Gaussian that describes the spatial distribution of a cell's
spots, in the units of the spot coordinates. The covariance is
cell_radius^2 times the identity. None uses half the mean equivalent radius,
sqrt(area / pi), of the segmented cells.

### `cell_type_prior`

**Default:** `'uniform'`

How the prior over cell types is computed:

- 'uniform': cell_type_weights are used unchanged throughout.
- 'weighted': the Zero weight from cell_type_weights is fixed, and the
weights of the other cell types are re-estimated at each iteration from
the current cell type probabilities, through a Dirichlet posterior.

### `cell_type_weights`

**Default:** `{'Zero': 0.5}`

Prior probabilities of the cell types. Types not listed share the remaining
probability equally, so {"Zero": 0.5} gives Zero 0.5 and divides the other
0.5 equally among the remaining types. None gives every type the same
weight. Names that do not match a cell type are ignored with a warning, and
values summing to more than 1 are normalised with a warning. There is no
'default' key.

The Zero class has zero expected expression for every gene. It takes cells
with few or no spots, such as segmentation artefacts and cells whose marker
genes are not in the panel.

### `voxel_size`

**Default:** `[1, 1, 1]`

Physical size of a voxel as [x, y, z], all in the same unit. Coordinates are
rescaled by the ratios to the x size, so that distances are correct when the
z step differs from the pixel size. For example, [0.147, 0.147, 0.9] for
0.147 um pixels and a 0.9 um z step. [1, 1, 1] is isotropic and applies to 2D
data.

### `remove_flat_cells`

**Default:** `True`

Remove cells that appear on a single z plane, which are usually segmentation
artefacts. 3D data only.

### `realtime_viewer`

**Default:** `False`

Show the cell typing in a browser while it runs. See
[Live viewer](./live-viewer.md).

### `realtime_viewer_port`

**Default:** `5001`

Port of the live viewer server.

### `realtime_viewer_fixed_radius`

**Default:** `None`

Radius at which the live viewer draws every cell. None draws each cell at its
own size.

## Runtime keys

Set by pciSeq during a run and stored in the same dictionary as the settings
above.

- `is3D`: whether the segmentation has more than one plane.
- `img_dim`: width, height and number of planes of the label image.
- `label_map`: mapping used to renumber non-sequential cell labels, or None.
