# The scale factors

Three corrections sit between the cell type definitions and the observed counts, each
rescaling the expected expression at a different level of detail. The
[warping the cell type definitions](../how-it-works/warping-the-reference.md) page
describes them; this page derives them.

| Factor | Indexed by | Corrects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[$\theta_{c\mid k}$](#theta)** | cell, class | the whole cell's total count, given the class |
| **[$\gamma_{g,c\mid k}$](#gamma)** | gene, cell, class | a given gene in a given cell, under a given class |
| **[$\eta_g$](#eta)** | gene only (global) | one gene across the whole experiment |

$\theta_c$ is one number for a cell, $\gamma_{g,c}$ one per gene in that cell, and
$\eta_g$ one per gene shared by every cell. Each absorbs the mismatch at its own scale.

$\gamma_{g,c}$ is kept as a full Gamma random variable so it can be **integrated out**,
which collapses the Poisson count model into the Negative Binomial the
[cell-class assignment](cell-class.md) scores against. $\theta_c$ is held as a point
estimate for that reason: a second mixing distribution in the rate would not collapse.

## The derivations

### Derivation: the cell scale factor $\theta_c$ {#theta}

The cell scale factor $\theta_c$ is an extension to the original model. Some cells yield
more transcripts than the reference predicts and others fewer; $\theta_c$ is a single
whole-cell correction across all of a cell's genes. Its prior is the conjugate
$\theta_c \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(r_\theta, r_\theta)$, mean $1$.

**Conditional on the class.** Both $\theta_c$ and the cell-gene factor
[$\gamma_{g,c}$](#gamma) are computed **conditional on a candidate class $k$**. The
predicted count a cell is compared against depends on which class the cell is assumed to be,
so the correction is class-specific. The estimate is written $\hat\theta_{c\mid k}$, and the
[cell-class assignment](cell-class.md) recomputes it for every class $k$ it tests the cell
against.

#### The point estimate

$\theta_c$ enters the intensity multiplicatively with the per-gene-per-cell factor
$\gamma_{g,c}$. If both were treated as full random variables, marginalising the
fluctuations would require integrating over the product of two Gamma distributions, giving
a Poisson-Gamma-Gamma mixture with no closed form, and the Negative Binomial likelihood
that drives cell typing would be lost. The variational distribution of $\theta_c$ is
therefore restricted to a point estimate (a Dirac delta centred at $\theta_c^*$):

$$
q(\theta_c) = \delta(\theta_c - \theta_c^*) .
$$

The Dirac makes the expectation exact, $\mathbb{E}[\log\theta_c] = \log\mathbb{E}[\theta_c]$,
so $\theta_c$ is a constant during the update for $\gamma_{g,c}$ and the Poisson-Gamma
conjugacy is preserved. Optimising the point estimate against the log-joint *including* the
prior term makes this a **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** step: the prior regularises the
estimate, shrinking it toward the baseline $1.0$ when the data for a cell are sparse.

#### The objective

This is a maximisation step. Conditioning on the class ($\zeta_{c,k} = 1$), the terms of
the log-joint that depend on $\theta_c$ are

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta_c) =
- \theta_c \sum_g \mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \gamma_{g,c}\, \eta_g
+ \sum_s z_{s,c}\, \log\theta_c
+ \underbrace{(r_\theta - 1)\log\theta_c - r_\theta\,\theta_c}_{\text{prior}}
+ \text{const}.
$$

The expectation over the other variational distributions $q(z)$, $q(\gamma)$ and $q(\eta)$
replaces the latent variables by their expected values:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\gamma,\eta,z}[\mathcal{L}(\theta_c)]
= - \theta_c \Big( A_c \sum_g \mu_{g,k}\, \bar\gamma_{g,c}\, \bar\eta_g + r_\theta \Big)
  + \log\theta_c \Big( \sum_s \bar z_{s,c} + r_\theta - 1 \Big) + \text{const}.
$$

#### Solving

Differentiating with respect to $\theta_c$ and setting the derivative to zero, with
$\bar N_c = \sum_s \bar z_{s,c}$ the expected total gene count of cell $c$:

$$
- \Big( A_c \sum_g \mu_{g,k}\, \bar\gamma_{g,c}\, \bar\eta_g + r_\theta \Big)
+ \frac{\bar N_c + r_\theta - 1}{\theta_c} = 0 .
$$

Solving gives the estimate

$$
\boxed{\;
\hat\theta_{c\mid k} = \frac{\bar N_c + r_\theta - 1}
                    {r_\theta + \sum_g A_c\, \mu_{g,k}\, \bar\gamma_{g,c}\, \bar\eta_g}
\;}
$$

The class $k$ enters through the reference mean $\mu_{g,k}$ in the denominator: a different
candidate class gives a different predicted total, and hence a different $\hat\theta_{c\mid k}$.

#### Reading the result

Up to the prior terms, the numerator is the observed number of spots in cell $c$, and the
denominator is the total count predicted for it under class $k$. So $\hat\theta_{c\mid k}$
is again an **observed-over-expected** ratio: greater than $1$ when the cell captures more
transcripts than the model predicts, less than $1$ when it captures fewer. A large
$r_\theta$ pulls the estimate toward the prior mean $1$, shrinking the correction when the
evidence is weak. Like $\gamma_{g,c}$, the estimate is computed conditional on the class
$k$, so it needs no weighting by $\bar\zeta_{c,k}$ in its own update.

#### The prior strength $r_\theta$

$r_\theta$ sets how far the data can move $\theta_c$ from $1$. The two limits:

- **Weak prior ($r_\theta$ small).** $\hat\theta_{c\mid k} \approx \bar N_c / (\text{predicted
  total under } k)$, the cell's observed count over what the class predicts.
- **Strong prior ($r_\theta \to \infty$).** $\hat\theta_{c\mid k} \to 1$, and the
  whole-cell correction is switched off.

A weak prior has one consequence for **near-empty cells**. For a cell with few spots,
small $\bar N_c$, $\hat\theta_{c\mid k}$ can collapse to a small value, and a small
$\theta$ scales the predicted expression of any class $k$ down toward the cell's counts. A
real class shrunk far enough predicts almost nothing, the same as an empty cell.

The **Zero class**, which expects no expression, is the class for such cells (see
[assigning cells to classes](../how-it-works/cell-to-celltype.md)). When the prior is
weak and $\theta$ collapses, a real class shrunk to imitate Zero can win the cell instead,
and the cell gets a spurious class.

A weaker prior lets the data set $\theta$ at the risk of near-empty cells being explained
by a collapsed class; a stronger prior holds $\theta$ near $1$ so those cells go to Zero.
The default `rTheta` is $25$.

### Derivation: the cell-gene scale factor $\gamma_{g,c}$ {#gamma}

The cell-gene scale factor $\gamma_{g,c}$ adjusts a single gene in a single cell. It is the
most fine-grained of the three [scale factors](#the-scale-factors), but it also plays a
special structural role: it is the factor that turns the Poisson count model into a
**Negative Binomial**, and that Negative Binomial is what the
[cell-class assignment](cell-class.md) scores each cell against. Unlike the cell scale
$\theta_c$, which is a [point estimate](#theta), $\gamma_{g,c}$ is kept as a full
Gamma random variable and **integrated out**.

**Conditional on the class.** Like [$\theta_c$](#theta), $\gamma_{g,c}$ is computed
**conditional on a candidate class $k$**: it measures how far gene $g$ in cell $c$ deviates
from the expression that class $k$ predicts, so the answer depends on which class the cell is
assumed to be. Every formula on this page carries that conditioning, written
$\gamma_{g,c}\mid k$, and the [cell-class assignment](cell-class.md) recomputes it for each
class it tests.

#### The count is a Poisson-Gamma mixture

Fix a gene $g$ and a cell $c$ of class $k$. The expected number of spots of that gene in
that cell, before the per-gene-cell fluctuation, is the deterministic predicted count

$$
\lambda_{g,c} = \mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \bar\eta_g\, \bar\theta_c ,
$$

the reference expression $\mu_{g,k}$ scaled by the inside-cell-bonus factor $A_c$ (see the
[notation table](overview.md#notation); $A_c = 1$ when the bonus is off), the gene efficiency
$\bar\eta_g$ and the cell scale $\bar\theta_c$. The scale factor $\gamma_{g,c}$ multiplies
this rate, and the observed count is Poisson around it:

$$
N_{c,g} \mid \gamma_{g,c} \;\sim\; \mathrm{Poisson}\big(\lambda_{g,c}\, \gamma_{g,c}\big),
\qquad
\gamma_{g,c} \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(r_\gamma, r_\gamma) .
$$

The prior $\mathrm{Gamma}(r_\gamma, r_\gamma)$ has mean $1$, so a priori the count sits at
$\lambda_{g,c}$ and deviates cell by cell through $\gamma_{g,c}$. A Poisson whose rate is a
Gamma random variable is a **Poisson-Gamma mixture**, which accommodates the overdispersion
of transcript counts.

#### Deriving the posterior $q(\gamma_{g,c})$

By the mean-field (CAVI) update, the optimal factor for $\gamma_{g,c}$ is the expected
log-joint over every other latent, with the $\gamma_{g,c}$-free terms folded into the
constant:

$$
\log q^*(\gamma_{g,c}) = \mathbb{E}_{-\gamma_{g,c}}\big[\log p(x,g,z,\zeta,\gamma,\eta,\theta)\big] + \text{const}.
$$

Conditioning on the class assignments $\zeta$, the class prior, the spatial term, and
$\bar N_{c,g}\,\overline{\log\theta_c}$ are all constant in $\gamma_{g,c}$. Three pieces
survive: the spatial integral contributes the linear term $-\lambda_{g,c}\,\gamma_{g,c}$, the
$\bar N_{c,g}$ expected spots each contribute a $\log\gamma_{g,c}$, and the prior
$\log p(\gamma_{g,c}) = (r_\gamma - 1)\log\gamma_{g,c} - r_\gamma\,\gamma_{g,c}$ adds two more:

$$
\log q(\gamma_{g,c} \mid k)
= \bar N_{c,g}\log\gamma_{g,c}
  - \lambda_{g,c}\,\gamma_{g,c}
  + \underbrace{(r_\gamma - 1)\log\gamma_{g,c} - r_\gamma\,\gamma_{g,c}}_{\text{prior } \log p(\gamma_{g,c})}
  + \text{const}.
$$

Gather the $\log\gamma_{g,c}$ terms and the linear $\gamma_{g,c}$ terms separately:

$$
\log q(\gamma_{g,c} \mid k)
= (\bar N_{c,g} + r_\gamma - 1)\log\gamma_{g,c}
  - (r_\gamma + \lambda_{g,c})\,\gamma_{g,c}
  + \text{const}.
$$

This is the log of a Gamma density; reading off its shape and rate:

$$
\boxed{\;
q(\gamma_{g,c} \mid k(c))
= \mathrm{Gamma}\big(
    \bar N_{c,g} + r_\gamma,\;\;
    r_\gamma + \mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \bar\eta_g\, \bar\theta_c
  \big)
\;}
$$

The posterior is conjugate, as the Poisson-Gamma structure guarantees. Its mean

$$
\bar\gamma_{g,c}
= \frac{\bar N_{c,g} + r_\gamma}{r_\gamma + \mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \bar\eta_g\, \bar\theta_c}
$$

is the **observed-over-expected** ratio for a single gene: the expected count
$\bar N_{c,g}$ over the prediction $\lambda_{g,c}$, regularised by $r_\gamma$. Where
$\theta_c$ rescales the whole cell at once, $\gamma_{g,c}$ rescales each gene individually.
Both are computed conditional on the class $k$.

#### Integrating $\gamma$ out: the Negative Binomial

The reason $\gamma_{g,c}$ is kept as a full Gamma rather than a point estimate is what
happens when it is **marginalised**. For the Poisson-Gamma pair above, integrating the rate
$\gamma_{g,c}$ against its $\mathrm{Gamma}(r_\gamma, r_\gamma)$ prior gives a closed-form
Negative Binomial for the count:

$$
N_{c,g} \mid \gamma_{g,c} \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{g,c}\,\gamma_{g,c}),
\quad
\gamma_{g,c} \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(r_\gamma, r_\gamma)
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
N_{c,g} \sim \mathrm{NB}(r_\gamma, \lambda_{g,c}),
$$

with mean $\lambda_{g,c}$ and variance $\lambda_{g,c} + \lambda_{g,c}^2/r_\gamma$. The
variance exceeds the mean, which a Poisson cannot produce; the Gamma mixing is what
accommodates the **overdispersion** of real counts. The shape $r_\gamma$ sets how much:
small $r_\gamma$ allows large deviations, large $r_\gamma$ approaches a Poisson at
$\lambda_{g,c}$.

This Negative Binomial is the per-gene likelihood that the
[cell-class assignment](cell-class.md) multiplies across genes to score a cell against each
candidate class. Keeping $\gamma_{g,c}$ conjugate, so that it can be integrated out in closed
form, is therefore what keeps cell typing tractable. It is also why $\theta_c$ is held as a
[point estimate](#theta): if it were a full random variable too, the rate would be a product
of two mixing distributions and this clean Poisson-Gamma collapse would be lost.

### Derivation: the in situ efficiency $\eta_g$ {#eta}

The efficiency $\eta_g$ is the most global of the three [scale factors](#the-scale-factors): a
per-gene parameter shared across all cells and classes, answering how efficiently gene $g$
is detected across the whole experiment. It is estimated as a **relative** factor $\eta_g'$
with prior mean $1.0$, while the baseline detection rate $\eta_0$ (the `Inefficiency`
setting, default $0.2$) stays as an explicit constant next to the reference mean - the
intensity carries the product $\eta_0\,\mu_{g,k}$, not a renamed symbol:

$$
\lambda_{g,c}(x) = \eta_0\,\mu_{g,k(c)}\, e^{-D_c(x)}\, \gamma_{g,c}\, \eta_g' .
$$

#### Per gene, shared across cells

Detection efficiency differs between genes: probe chemistry, sequence and length make some
transcripts easier to read out than others, so $\eta_g$ is estimated **per gene**. It is
shared across **all** cells because the detection rate of a gene is a property of the
assay, not of a cell. $\gamma_{g,c}$ varies cell by cell: $\eta_g$ is how well the gene is
detected anywhere, $\gamma_{g,c}$ how far this gene in this cell deviates from its class.

#### Deriving the posterior $q(\eta_g')$

The prior is $\eta_g' \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(r_\eta, r_\eta)$, whose log-density is

$$
\log p(\eta_g') = (r_\eta - 1)\log\eta_g' - r_\eta\,\eta_g' .
$$

By the mean-field (CAVI) update, the optimal factor for $\eta_g'$ is the expected log-joint
over every other latent, with all the $\eta_g'$-free terms folded into the constant:

$$
\log q^*(\eta_g') = \mathbb{E}_{-\eta_g'}\big[\log p(x,g,z,\zeta,\gamma,\eta,\theta)\big] + \text{const}.
$$

Writing $\eta_g = \eta_0\,\eta_g'$, only three pieces of the joint carry $\eta_g'$. The
predicted-count term is linear in $\eta_g'$; each observed spot of gene $g$ contributes a
$\log\eta_g'$ through the per-spot log-intensity (since $\log\eta_g = \log\eta_0 + \log\eta_g'$
and $\log\eta_0$ is constant); and the prior adds its two terms:

$$
\log q(\eta_g')
= -\Big(\sum_{c,k}\zeta_{c,k}\,\theta_c\,\eta_0\mu_{g,k}\,A_c\,\gamma_{g,c}\Big)\eta_g'
  + \Big(\sum_{s:\,g_s=g}\sum_{c,k} z_{s,c}\,\zeta_{c,k}\Big)\log\eta_g'
  + (r_\eta-1)\log\eta_g' - r_\eta\,\eta_g'
  + \text{const}.
$$

Now simplify the $\log\eta_g'$ coefficient, the double sum over the gene-$g$ spots and over
the cell-class pairs. Both $z_{s,c}$ and $\zeta_{c,k}$ are latent indicators: a cell has one
true class and a spot one true parent cell, but neither is known, so inference carries the
posterior probabilities over them, the soft assignments $\bar z_{s,c}$ and the class
probabilities $\bar\zeta_{c,k}$. Taking the expectation splits the product under the mean-field
factorisation, $\mathbb{E}[z_{s,c}\,\zeta_{c,k}] = \bar z_{s,c}\,\bar\zeta_{c,k}$, and the
sum over $k$ uses that a cell's class probabilities form a distribution,
$\sum_k \bar\zeta_{c,k} = 1$. The coefficient becomes

$$
\bar N_g = \sum_{s:\,g_s=g}\sum_c \bar z_{s,c},
$$

the **expected** number of reads of gene $g$ assigned to cells. Replacing the remaining latents
by their variational means ($\gamma\!\to\!\bar\gamma$, $\theta\!\to\!\bar\theta$) and gathering
the $\log\eta_g'$ and the linear $\eta_g'$ terms:

$$
\log q(\eta_g')
= (\bar N_g + r_\eta - 1)\log\eta_g'
  - \Big(r_\eta + \sum_{c,\,k\neq\text{zero}} \bar\zeta_{c,k}\, \eta_0\mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \bar\gamma_{g,c}\, \bar\theta_c\Big)\eta_g'
  + \text{const}.
$$

This is the log of a Gamma density; reading off its shape and rate:

$$
\boxed{\;
q(\eta_g')
= \mathrm{Gamma}\Big(
    \bar N_g + r_\eta,\;\;
    r_\eta + \sum_{c,\,k\neq\text{zero}} \bar\zeta_{c,k}\, \eta_0\mu_{g,k}\, A_c\, \bar\gamma_{g,c}\, \bar\theta_c
  \Big)
\;}
$$

*Note.* Background and Zero-cell reads are not produced by a class profile, so in practice $\bar N_g$
excludes them. $\eta_g'$ is then reads observed in real-class cells (ie any class except Zero) over reads predicted for them.

The sum runs over all cells and candidate classes, weighted by the soft class assignments
$\bar\zeta_{c,k}$, since $\eta_g'$ is shared and aggregates evidence from every cell. A value
$\eta_g' > 1$ means gene $g$ is detected better than the baseline, $\eta_g' < 1$ worse.

#### The efficiency term against the background

$\eta_g$ depends only on the gene, so it takes the same value for every candidate cell in
a [spot-to-cell assignment](spot-assignment.md) and cancels between cells. It acts in one
place: the comparison between a cell and the **background**. The background scores a spot
with the [misread density](misread-density.md) $\rho_g$ alone, which carries no efficiency
term, so $\eta_g$ is the one factor on the cell's side without a counterpart. A gene with a
small $\eta_g$ has its signal attenuated against the background and its spots are more
readily called misreads.

The original paper dropped this term, which inflated the signal-to-noise ratio for poorly
detected genes.
