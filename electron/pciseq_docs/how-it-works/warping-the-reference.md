# 2. Warping the cell type definitions

The cell type definitions give the mean expression of each gene in each class. The
observed counts are on a different scale: detection efficiency differs between genes,
transcript yield differs between cells, and the two datasets differ in overall scale.
pciSeq rescales the expected expression to the scale of the current experiment before
comparing. The rescaling is the warp.

The step reads the current gene counts per cell, the current cell class estimates and the
raw cell type definitions, and produces a warped expected expression rescaled at every
level. [Cell typing](cell-to-celltype.md) scores cells against classes using it.

The correction factors are nuisance parameters. They are estimated because the cell
classes and spot assignments depend on them, they are not in the output, and nothing
observed corresponds to them directly. They are identified through the agreement they
produce between cells and their assigned classes.

## The scaling factors

The warp is a family of four factors, each rescaling the expected expression at a
different level of detail. pciSeq calls them inefficiencies. From the broadest to the
most specific:

- **Inefficiency.** One constant for the whole reference, the `Inefficiency` setting.
  It rescales every gene in every cell type definition to the overall scale of the
  observed counts. It can be below or above 1.

- **eta** ($\eta_g$). One factor per gene, shared by all cells: the gene's detection
  efficiency relative to the constant above.

- **theta** ($\theta_{c\mid k}$). One factor per cell and candidate class: the cell's
  total yield relative to what the class predicts, applied to all its genes.

- **gamma** ($\gamma_{g,c\mid k}$). One factor per gene, cell and candidate class: the
  residual mismatch of a given gene in a given cell that the broader factors leave.

Inefficiency and eta do not depend on the cell's class. theta and gamma do, since the
expectation they correct is class-specific, and they are computed for every candidate
class. That is what lets [cell typing](cell-to-celltype.md) score a cell against every
class.

## Granularity of the factors

Ordered by how much of the experiment each covers: Inefficiency applies to everything,
gamma to a given gene in a given cell under a given class.

<figcaption>The four factors by granularity.</figcaption>
</figure>

Four factors are needed because the mismatch occurs at all four levels at once: a
global scale difference between the two datasets, a per-gene detection pattern, per-cell
variation in yield, and gene-by-cell noise. Each factor absorbs the mismatch at its own
scale.

The factors are applied together. For each (cell, gene, class) triplet the expected
expression is the reference value times Inefficiency, eta, theta and gamma.

The [demo](scale-factors-demo.md) puts three of them on sliders over five cells generated
from known class definitions.

## Inefficiencies

Every inefficiency is the same statistic, a ratio of observed over expected:

$$
\text{factor} \;=\;
\frac{\text{observed}}{\text{expected}}
$$

- **gamma** compares the observed count of a *given gene in a given cell* with its
  expected count, under a candidate class.
- **theta** compares the observed total count of a *given cell* with its expected
  total, under a candidate class.
- **eta** compares the observed count of a *given gene across all cells* with its
  expected total.

A factor is greater than 1 when the observed count exceeds the expected count and less
than 1 otherwise. The factors differ only in the level of aggregation before the ratio
is formed.

## The priors

Each factor has a prior with mean 1, no rescaling, whose strength is a hyperparameter:
`rGene` for eta, `rTheta` for theta, `rSpot` for gamma. How far a factor moves from 1
depends on that hyperparameter against the number of counts available to estimate it,
and those counts differ by orders of magnitude between the three levels.

- **eta** is estimated from one gene's spots across the whole section, typically thousands. At
  the default `rGene` of 20 the prior is negligible and the data determine the final (that is,
  posterior) eta.
- **theta** is estimated from one cell's spots, typically tens. At the default `rTheta` of 25 the
  prior is comparable to the data. Lower it to around 2 and the data determine the posterior
  theta. It has to stay above 1: theta is
  $(\text{spots} + r_\theta - 1) / (r_\theta + \text{expected})$, so at 1 or below a cell with no
  spots gives a theta of zero or less.
- **gamma** is estimated from a given gene in a given cell, usually a fraction of a spot. The default
  `rSpot` of 2 therefore dominates, which is the intent: there is too little data at that level
  to estimate anything on its own. `rSpot` is also the dispersion of the negative binomial, since
  integrating gamma out is what produces it.

Raising a hyperparameter holds its factor near 1; lowering it lets the data set it. A
starting value for `rTheta` is the typical number of counts in a cell.

## The spatial factor (the MRF)

Cells of the same class cluster in space, in layers or regions. When a cell is scored
against the classes, each class receives a bonus proportional to the weighted number of
the cell's neighbours that carry it, closer neighbours weighted more. This is the
spatial term, a Markov random field (MRF), where a cell's label depends on its
neighbours' labels. `mrf_beta` sets its strength; at `0` only the gene counts and the
prior decide the class. It is described with the cell typing step in
[cell to class](cell-to-celltype.md#the-class-prior-and-the-spatial-term).

<!-- Parked, bring it back with the rest of the story:

A cell with almost no spots has nothing to weigh against its neighbours, so the spatial
term alone can decide its class.

On its own the sentence states the problem and leaves the reader with no way out, so it
needs the settings that hold such a cell back: a heavier prior on the Zero class through
`cell_type_weights`, and a larger `rTheta`, which keeps theta near 1 in a cell with few
counts instead of letting the data shrink it. Say when each one is the right knob, and
what it costs. -->
